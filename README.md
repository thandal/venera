# Venera : Venus Planetary Radar Astronomy
## Doppler-Delay Image Processing

WORK IN PROGRESS -- the code is still under development, and has been hacked up to produce various outputs.

- Use `wget_venus_data.sh` to download data, for example `wget_venus_data.sh ocp_2015` to get all the OCP imgs from 2015. 
- Use process_radar_images.ipynb to do processing (or use parallel_process_radar_images.sh to run it in parallel -- but you need a lot of memory!)
- Use process_video.ipynb to assemble videos.
